# Oblique Strategies
Oblique Strategies (subtitled Over One Hundred Worthwhile Dilemmas) is a card-based method for promoting creativity jointly created by Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt.

This python script simulates the card-based method.

## Usage: python oblique.py <-h (optional: prints description)> <number of cards to draw (optional: default = 1)>

## Description:
These cards arise from operations involving the underlying principles of processes.
They've been discovered by intuition catching up with intellect and in other cases formulated to solve dilemmas.

These cards are intended to be used as a pack (set of possibilities for review in the mind) or by drawing a single card from the pack when a dilemma occurs in a working situation.

In the latter case, the card is trusted even when its appropriateness is quite unclear.

The cards are not final as new ideas will present themselves and others will become self evident.
